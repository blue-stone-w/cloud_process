a collection of tools for solving the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem in compute vision. RANSAC and sevral variants are extracted from the TheiaSfM package.<br>

PnP solvers:
* Kneip's original P3P solver using TooN (P3p)
* Kneip's original P3P solver using Eigen (Kneip_P3P)
* P2P algorithm with known gravity (TODO)<br>

dependencies:
stlplus3(STLplus C++ library collection);
